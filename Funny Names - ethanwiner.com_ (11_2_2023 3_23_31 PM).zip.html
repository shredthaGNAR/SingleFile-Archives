Funny Names

Read all about
Ethan's new
book, The Audio Expert.

Most of the names on this page are original, but some are from the
"Credits" page at the Car Talk web site and a few others were submitted by site visitors.
You are welcome to send me funny names to add to this list, but note
that I post only names that could be real. So please don't be the hundredth person to send
me Amanda Huginkiss, since that is not a real last name. And I have enough
"Dick" names and other bawdy names. Please, no more! Same for Wayne King - it's
just not that funny.
There's one exception to my "must be real" rule. My
friend, jazz drummer Adam Nussbaum, submitted the hilarious list of "Big Band"
names at the bottom of this page.
Eric Oliver sent a boat-load of funny names, and they're in a group
farther down the page.
This page has some pretty good ones too: With a Name Like That
Also see my People I'd Like to Know
page and my Smileys collection.

Longer Submissions
From my good friend Rob Carlson: "Our names for the Les
Talent Five Minus One band were Les Talent, Kenny Hackett, Dewey Needham and the
lovely Gina Lobudgeta."
Someone sent me this: "A coworker whose last name is Naze
wanted to name his daughter May Ann Naze but his wife refused."
Then a few months later I received this: "I believe I was that
child. My dad (Robert Naze) used to tell me that story all the time when I was a little
girl. He and my grandfather both wanted that to be my name because they thought it was
hilarious, but my mom refused because she didn't want me to get made fun of as a child. My
name instead ended up being Melissa Ann Naze."
Someone else sent me this: "My aunt's name is Debra May Page
and she married Patrick Dye, so now she is called Debra May Dye!! Lol!!"
And this is from another Dye: "My maiden name is Mandy Brown
and I married Timmy Dye. My name is now Mandy Brown Dye. Our marriage announcement in the
local paper read BROWN-DYE. I also know siblings named Rusty Keys and Penny Keys. I almost
named my kids May Dye and Will Dye. My husband wouldn't have it!"
Meg Boner sent me this: "This one is real - it's mine. My
maiden name was Meg Ann Childress. Nothing exciting. Well, I married Alan Boner, and now I
am Meg A. Boner!"
I love this recent submission: "My friend's name is Crystal
Ware and has been made fun of all of her life for it. She's been called names like
Tupperware, silverware, and the famous underwear."
This is from Misty Cupp: "My maiden name is Misty Cupp (Miss
Tea Cup). I am now Mason. My family jokes that I went from a tea cup to a Mason jar. I
have a cousin named Crystal Cupp."
And this: "Our last name is Reitz pronounced rights. When my
husband and I were expecting our son he wanted to name him William Oliver Reitz (Bill O.
Reitz) [but] I wouldn't go for it."
From Kristin G: "When I was a teenager, I worked with a woman
named Terry (spelled that way) who married a man with the last name Terry (yes, spelled
that way) so her name was Terry Terry. In a neighboring town, many years ago, a family
named Teed had two sons, whom they named Warren and Garren. Finally, in our local phone
book is a listing which appears as 'Miss, Kris' which, of course, would make her name
'Kris Miss.' Sometimes I wonder what in the world parents are thinking!!!"
From Robert Eisenschmidt: "I have a friend, Bill Land, who
named his daughter Alison Wanda Land. His wife changed the name on the birth certificate
when she found out."
From Joyce: "I enjoyed your website, especially the funny
names. Where I work, there is a woman named Constance Sweat and another named Elizabeth
Ard - she detests being called Liz Ard and prefers Beth. I knew another girl who named her
son Eddy Bair."
From Phil Simms: "I knew a girl that went to Westside High in
Omaha Nebraska named Summer Holiday."
From Theresa Glass: "When I was pregnant with my oldest son I
wanted to name him Otto. Our last name is Glass. Otto Glass (auto glass). His dad wouldn't
allow it."
From John Klaessy: "My sister, Ann Klaessy (pronounced classy),
lives near you in Suffield, CT. She married a guy with the last name of Ho. She took her
maiden name as her middle name. Therefore, her name is A. Klaessy Ho."
From Denny Lease: "Here in Walla Walla, Washington (a funny
name in itself) we once had a Dr. Ruff and a Dr. Au (pronounced OW)."
From Anna Mirer: "My grandfather's name was Les Cash, his wife
was named Dess, and together they owned and operated the Cash Inn."
From Chris Von Feldt: "Kit Wong married Jason Chiu - so she's
Kit Chiu (and an architect in Seattle). She said it sounded funny and wanted to hyphenate
to Kit Wong-Chiu. I said 'what about the right shoe.' She said to go ahead and stick with
the sneeze name."
From Mariah Mann: "My husband's name is Clay Mann. We have
often thought of names for children ... Anita Mann, Hugh Mann, Matt Mann, Eileen
Mann." [EW: What about Batt Mann?]
From Ashleigh Conners: "My name is Ashleigh Connors, my
fiancée is John Tray. So when I get married I will become Ashleigh Tray. All my friends
call me Ash. Ash Tray."
From Dan Jeckering: "I went to school with a family with the
last name of Schauers (pronounced showers). They had three daughters named Misty, Dawn and
April."
From Sam Ann Fisher: "I saw your page of funny names and I
thought wow my name belongs here. I never figured out why I got named this but it's
hilarious."
From Yvonne Iwasa: "My cousin's wife is Cherrie Crisp. My
friend's dad is Wally Wacker."
From Jerry Brown: "My former wife's first husband was named
Green, my name is Brown, she later married Robert Gray."
From Cal Ernst: "Back in the early 70s I went to college with
two girls, Trudy Will and Cathy May. Probably not very funny on their own, but we had a
good time with it back then. 'Cathy May but Trudy Will.' They were both good looking,
too."
From Angeline Coffin: "My name is A. Glass Coffin. My
daughter-in-law was J. L. Beyt (jail bait). My sister was Betty Carr Glass and is now
Betty Glass Ware."
From Coby Unger: "My parents almost named me Thurston
Unger."
From Lonna Levine: "In my mother-in-law's family, her own
mother's name is Ginger Mintz, and she has cousins named John and Candace Mintz whose
nicknames growing up were Pepper and Candy."
From Brittany Shorrock: "My best friend's name is Erin May
Read. I don't think her parents realized what they did. LOL."
From Teri Wright: "On funny names, I have came across a few
through my work: Justin Towne and Heaven Leigh Day are the most recent. At my previous job
I came across Dick Manley and Peter Pann. I have a brother that works for an insurance
company, and he could not believe the name of the claimant. It seems he was to be named a
variation of his dad's name, Lester, so they named him Moe Lester."
From Tony Franklin: "A colleague of mine lectures part time at
a university. His name is Mike Coffey, and confusion sometimes occurs when students or
staff ask his whereabouts. He takes his black."
From Kris Woods: "I know of an Air Force Major who's name is
Richard, goes by Dick, last name Holder. So officially he is Major Dick Holder. Real
person."
"I had to write to you about my aunt. Her name is Winifred, but
growing up she always went by Windy. She's had 3 or 4 husbands now, but her latest has the
last name of Rump. Yes, I have an aunt Windy Rump."
"My name is Cori Ander (like the spice) and my goal is to one
day be part of the pop sensation known as the Spice Girls. I also have two classmates
(sisters) Shelly May Dye and Catherine Will Dye."
From Robin Hyde: "I did the orientations for the new inmates
arriving at the state prison in Arizona. I would start out my session by writing my name
on the chalkboard and then introduce myself by saying 'Hi, my name is Robin Hyde. I
understand some of you used to do that for a living.'"
From Tim: "In college, my friend Susie Beaver was roommates
with Molly Shaver."
From Brett Kissane: "Michigan's attorney general is named Mike
Cox. One of his commercials says "Mike Cox is hard on the issues."
From Harold Jewell: "If operatic singer Kathleen Battle married
classical pianist Emanuel Ax, she'd be Kathleen Battle Ax."
From cherokeeblazer: "There was Count D'Monet who of course has
a lovely wife named Anita (Anita D'Monet). They have a son named Owen but he didn't like
the eurpoean "D" so he is just Owen Monet."
From Charlie Mitchell: "In the early 1990s, I worked with a man
by the name of Pepsi diCola. I also know of a man named Coca diCola. The two are not
related. You gotta love the Italians."
From Ron Jones: "My first manager at Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto
was Brooks Esser. Not too amusing, until I realized his first initial and last name are B.
Esser. I first realized this in his presence, and I laughed out loud right in front of
him, pretty much uncontrolled for a good 30 seconds!!! He wasn't amused."
From Cynthia Purdy: "I know a girl named Isabelle-Marie Maddon.
She married a guy whose last name is Kersing. In Quebec, we are not allowed to drop our
maiden names, but it's acceptable to hyphenate our married names. So now her name is I.M.
Maddon-Kersing (I am mad and cursing)."
From Christiana Hundley: "I saw your list and I have to add Dr.
Harry Bear in Richmond, VA, Dr. Smiley, DDS in Chesterfield, VA, and Mrs. Clara Fiddler,
my elementary school music teacher, John Strange Elementary in Indianapolis, IN"
From Jim Ware: "I'm JR Ware. We have an A Ware and a B Ware in
our family. When I was in the Air Force, Sgt. and Mrs. Hohole named their kid Ophelia.
Poor girl."
From Jeremy Mays: "Being in the military we get some pretty
funny names with the ranks.
Major Payne - Yes he worked at the hospital.
Captain Hook - A friend's officer in charge of his section.
Colonel Sergeant - My base commander in Korea. To me it's funny because a Colonel is an
officer and a Sergeant is enlisted."
From Molly Shackleford: "When I worked at the Smithfield Police
Department, in Smithfield, VA, I had the chance to work with a Detective named Burt
Nurney. He would get audibly frustrated (over the police radio) if anyone said his name
too fast. I gathered that he was not a fan of Sesame Street."
From Dawn Epstein: "I worked for Centronics in the late 70s to
early 80s, and we had an electronic parts representative whose name was D.C. Current. He
swore it was genuinely his birth name, and added that his father's name was 'A.C. Current,
and they rectified the situation.'"
From Becky Friday: "I have a couple actual names for you from
the area where I live (Bay City, Michigan): Lester and Esther Festerling (married couple),
Rusty and Sandy Pyles (married couple), Sonny & Rosie Holes (married couple), Weiner
& Cox Law Firm (Detroit). PS: My last name is Friday, and when I was born, the nurses
in the hospital tried talking my Mom and Dad into naming me "Tuesday Friday," as
Tuesday Weld was a popular actress then. Also, I have a sister-in-law named Jo
Friday."
From Doug Horton: "I had a veterinary who was called Peter Nutt
(P. Nutt) and his wife's name was Hazel."
From Bena: "There was a female private I used to know in Ottawa
when I was in the military. Her name was Sheila Rose Richardson. She married a serviceman
surnamed Hiscock and became Sheila Rose Hiscock."
From Carol Dasseos: "My mother told me about a girl in her
elementary school who was named Etta Byrd. They used to tease her every time her name was
called by saying, 'How did it taste?'"
From Cory Schaan: "My last name is Schaan and my children are
Olivia Newton Schaan and Elton Schaan."
From Ricky Small: "As you can see from my email, my name is
Richard Allan Small. I'm actually the third. You can imagine the fun people had with my
name. Eg. Small, Dick; Dick Small; Dicky Smalls. I always joke that "Small,
Dicks" run in the family. I used to hate my name but now I embrace it, and it's fun
to have a funny name if you have a good sense of humor.
From someone who prefers to remain anonymous: "My grandpa's
name was John Oder, his son's name (my uncle) was also John Oder. To further terrorize the
next generation my uncle named his first daughter Shelly Oder, thus all her life she has
grown up being called Smelly Oder."
From Randy Beecher Bacon II: "From the time I've been young I
have always been hassled about my name. My full name is Randy Beecher Bacon II (Beat Your
Bacon). Yep, I am not the only one. My dad grew up with this interesting name and he
decided that I was worthy of his namesake. When I was young it bothered me, but now it is
nice to stand out, and a lot of people think its awesome for some reason, also."
From Boyd L. Simonson: "The driver of the truck, which moved
our furniture from South Carolina to California in 1995, was named Stu D. Baker. He
laughed about it, so it didn't bother him."
From David Sellars: My wife Ruth's nickname was Dusty when I met
her. She became Dusty Sellars. As a kid my den mother was Mavis Davis. I had a co-worker
name Edric Chun (gotta say it kinda fast) whose nickname was Bone. I had to ask why they
called him Bone. They told me, say his name kinda fast. There is a family here in Hawaii
named Silva. They named one son Hiho and the other Quick (for real). One of my friend's
sister in High School was Nancy Olmstead. She married a guy named Kim Yancy.
From David Way: My brother, for years before he had kids swore he
loved the name Noah. But when he did finally have a son, he could not pull the trigger and
name him Noah Way.
From Melody Goodnight: Real person, my mom, her name is Anita
Goodnight. Her maiden name was Anita Bible, her mother's last name was Johnson, so had she
not married my grandpa and still had my mother her name would/could have been Anita
Johnson. My name is Melody Goodnight, obviously my maiden name which I took back when I
divorced my ex-husband so that I could say ... wait for it ... I was always a goodnight
... lol. Always gets a giggle.
From Jennifer Comeau: My ex-husbands great uncle's name was Otto Moe
Beal. He passed away in the late 80's; he owned and operated a service station in
Illinois. He begged relatives to name a daughter Snow Moe. Nope, didn't happen.
From Katrina Kufrin: A girl a few years older than me in my hometown
was Sandy Eigo. I worked at a university bookstore in the late 70's, the director was
Harold Ball, he hung around with the ROTC guy, his name was Richard Head. Yes, they would
introduce themselves as Dick Head and Harry Ball! While I was in the Navy, I often had to
check ID cards, one that is memorable is Billy Hill, written on ID card as Hill, Billy.
From Glenda Denny: I saw the list of funny names on your website and
thought you might want to add my high school science teacher, Rod Tickle to the list. Yes,
that is his real name.
From Rick: Went to school with a girl named "Robyn Crowe"
and a friend of mine married a girl named "Candy Sweet," and no, it's not a
stage name, she's actually as sweet as she can be pardon the pun. They met after high
school in 1978 in Western NY outside Buffalo. I went to school with Robyn from 7th grade
up. I also went with a girl from Kent Island whose name was Cathy or "Kathy
Semen" who got married and took the surname "Creme." So a "very
friendly" "free spirited," um, tartish very attractive young lady became
"Kathy Semen-Creme." Not one word of it a lie.
From Robert Bolstad: Tobar, Nevada, pronounced "To bar."
Nothing remains of this town except building foundations. It was located on the Western
Pacific Railroad mainline and was originally a construction town. These were the original
knock-down towns; when the railroad construction moved further down the line, the
proprietors simply disassembled their structures and moved on. Without exception, the
first two businesses to set up shop were the houses of ill repute and the bars. One
enterprising bar owner put up a sign with an arrow indicating the direction to his
establishment. After the construction moved on, a few townspeople remained. Evidently a
passing railroad inspector whose job consisted of naming all the new towns on the line saw
this sign which had been left behind, and having a sense humor, named the town what he had
read on the sign. A much more lucid account can be found in the book "Portrait of a
Silver Lady: The Train They Called the California Zephyr" by Ted Benson and Bruce A.
MacGregor.

From William Richardson: I knew a girl back in high school, named
Candy. She became engaged to a man with the last name Apple. Yup, Candy Apple!

From Roger Grupp
I have created a fictional brass quintet, the Effenheimer Brass,
that is all about funny names I have thought of. Virtually all of them are ones I
conceived, and are plausible names:
Felix Austead (feel exhausted)
Mary Ann Bright Trina Corder ($3.25)
Carrie Couture (caricature)
Mike Czech (mic check)
Joaquin DeFlores (walkin' the floors)
Marguerite DeVille (Margaritaville)
Lindsay Doyle (linseed oil)
Neil Dupre (kneel to pray)
Emile Eaton (a meal eaten)
Kristie Hannity (Christianity)
Nina Levin (911)
Ty Malone (time alone)
Rosa Shore (rows ashore)
Walt Smedley (waltz medley)
Reed Toomey (read to me)
My favorites are a little contrived: Doug Love-Fitzhugh (the glove
fits you) and Zoe Mudgett Hertz (so much it hurts).

From Eric Oliver
Growing up, our next door neighbors were Larry and Sally Shade.
Larry's brother married a girl named Kathy Lamp. When she married into the family, she
couldn't resist hyphenating her last name, thus becoming Kathy Lamp-Shade.
While I was in college, I fell ill and had to go visit Dr Kluck.
Although he may sound like a bit like a quack, he was the best doctor I ever visited in
college.
If you go to Duke Energy's web site you will see their legal team
consists of Ruff and Manly:
Would you like your clergy to be Rev. M. T. Head?
Ever know a good man? Now you do: Noah Goodman.
You must add I.P. Looney to your I.P. list.
Elaine Hew was survived by her sister, Annie Hew.
Rocky Stone founded the Hearing Loss Association of America - dare I
say he was deaf as a stone?
Harry Boyle kinda disgusts me.
Let's don't forget the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's girls
basketball coach Sandy Botham.
I've been told (but can't confirm) that my friend's father, David
Sparks, is partners with Rich Burns and they sell fire insurance.
I know a Simi Baer but we can't forget the rest of the clan: Norma
Lee, Ima, Ted E., Teddi, Harry, Rhoda, and Stella.
There is a Dr. Cockburn, a urologist in Tampa, FL.
Arya Reddy?
Names that should be real, but I have never met:
* Ima Klotz and her sister, Sasha Klotz
* Marv Ellis
* Cole Durkee
* Thor Luther
* Mona Little, and after marriage Mona Little-Moore (or Mona Lott and Mona Lott-Moore)
* Mark A. Roni
* Dee Flower
* Braxton Hicks
* Michael Otto Nuys
* M.T. Toombe
* Ima Gaye-Barr
* Manny Bones
* Myra Mains
* Dusty Carr
* Mary Gold
* Bob Sledd
I worked with a guy that named his sons Hunter, Fisher, Trapper, and
Skinner ... poor kids.
I know you said no more bawdy names, but in college there were two
girls that took more than their share of abuse. One of them was named Jenny Titsworth (and
she took more than her share of those too). The other was Michelle Elaine Rector, aka
Michelle E. Rector. I wouldn't share them if they weren't true...
My full name is Eric Paul Oliver, but until I was about 7 I was
teased by my friends and called Eric P. All over. I trust my secret is safe with you. :-)
