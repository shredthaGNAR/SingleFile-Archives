RELOCATING BLOG/SITE!!! Vast improvements ahead in future: shredthe-gnar.com

I have finally decided to commit to this site/blog and have subsequently registered a domain. The new blog will be http://www.shredthe-gnar.com and it will be a vastly different site/setup: more updates, better info, more interaction: better in every sense. I have a quite a background in building websites and am looking forward to this. The only reason it took so long was because when i decide to engage in endeavors such as this, i like to do it the best i possibly can, and with the many other projects i have going online (plus life in general) i was hesitant. However the page is up NOW: now information has been transferred, nor is it operational but i suggest bookmarking it and checking back often and soon. I am looking forward to this project and should be a very beneficial and fun site that we can profit from. It also will allow me some cathartic value: i will be able to post my meanderings and ran-dumb ponderings on my mind. Check it out and hopefully we can get CAKED UP!!!!!!!! and have a profitable 2010-11 NHL season!! See you soon and email me if you have any questions or would like to help or have suggestions etc.SHREDps please excuse the rambling it is 5:30am. Was playing some Omaha HI poker (winning) and putting the website backbones together AND looking over the plays for tomorrow, in which i found quite a few in which i like A LOT. And again always check me out @ the pregame.com forums, i post under shredthe_gnar mostly in the NHL forum but im all around.

NHL Picks for October 3rd, 2011

October 3rd, 2010PicksFLA -135 3 unitsATL @ FLA OVER 5.5 -115 3 unitsDAL -105 1 unitTOR @ WSH UNDER 6 -120 1 unitSome Write UpsDAL - the West has won roughly six of every 10 matchups against the East over the past five seasons. The western conference is spread out over three time zones thus they are used to travel and the rigor that comes with it: they are well-conditioned to traveling. On the contrary the EASTERN conference is sequestered in ONE timezone (the EST). Therefore when EAST teams travel to the Pacific, they're forced to make adjustments to their schedules and most often struggle as a result. IN ADDITION, when facing the WEST, EASTERN team often are on road trips of 3+ games when they head out west.(PIT plays ANA and PHX next) These trips have historically proven to be costly for EAST teams. The WEST has a terrific 314-146-25-26 home mark against the East. The WEST is +27.38 units since the lockout.TOR just lost their captain, coming off a B2B and my model has a projected total of 3.95 (1.65, 2.29 respectively) Neuvirth has had a fine year but not against TOR w/ a GAA&gt;4 and Gustavson gave up over 4 goals to WSH in 1 game but this year has a GAA of 2.52. This game could go either way, but i like the under here; 3-1Leans Boston PL +230  (Lalime in goal who is 0-2-0 w/ SV% .871 and GAA 4.04) Boston allowed 1.38 goals/game while scoring 3.17. Boston has allowed 0.50 goals on the road and scored 3.40 this year.Toronto +210 Gustavson has poor record/GAA vs WSH and Neuvirth on the contrary has had quite a fine year but against TOR has a GAA &gt;4. Worried about B2B though. Pondering the UNDER 6 in the game using the logic TOR coming of B2B but i need to research trends of how they battle backTBL @ ANA OVER 5.5 -130 Pit @ Dal OVER 5.5 -125 ....More picks and write ups will be forthcoming in a rather expedited fashion....or when i can haha BOL.

Best time of the year! Vegas Trip, NHL Picks and Some Advice

The NHL season is getting under way, b ball starting, almost half way thru Football(chargers need to get it together however its not entirely their fault, read about the luck faction @ advancednhlstats.com) and the World Series is on; which im currently watching thus this will be a short post. I will begin to post more and update the blog; perhaps to its own domain/url and upgrade the layout and design and of course add more content, including links to interesting topics, stats, picks and miscellaneous stuff to help you get caked up and pick more winners- bang the book!Little about me: I just returned from Vegas in which i proceeded to win $ @ the sportsbook and blackjack but then subsequently dumped it off to goodies, strippers, booze and the like. I also happened to run in to a few members of the Bolivian Marching Powder Army. Great trip and i shall be returning soon, since i can get rooms for cheap all i need is a friend (preferably hot chick, but a guy that likes to gamble and have fun is alright in my book) and a 5 hour drive: Easy. Went 5-1 yesterday in my first day of posting picks(NHL) over @ pregame.com forums check them out, my only loss was the NKD @ ANA and i took the OVER, the stats where basically flashing hit the over, espically getting +110! The stats i predicted transpired: 70 SOG, 8+ power plays etc however only 3 found the net. Thats how gambling works; its gambling! There is no sure thing (well lets not get in to that, point shaving people on the take etc) It is all about the long run, which parallels with a lot of things in life and business. If you continue to make decisions that are + EV (have positive expected value) in the long run you will be rewarded. Thats what i try to maximize in my life: making +EV decisions no matter the circumstance and then let the cards fall where they may. And in the interim i may experience a period of loss but things will get better because if i am making the correct decisions things will balance out due to things regressing to the mean. Thats what the long run is all about: regression to or toward the mean. If i keep doubling down on 11 10x and never win that doesn't mean i am expected to hit the next 11, but it does mean that things will balance out, you just need to have the appropriate length to experience it. That is why bankroll management is so important: it allows you to survive the downs w/o having to decrease your bet size b/c then when it does start to revert back to the average you won't reap the full benefits.I wrote too much! Damn adderall. I need to go watch the World Series; Rangers in 6!NHL Picks for 10/30Min EVEN 1 unitBuf @ Dal OVER 5.5 -120 1 unit NSH @ COL OVER 5.5 -125 2 unitsNSH +125 2 units2010-11 Posted Picks YTD 5-1 +3.2 units

A Prelude to Playoff Picks: The Future of the Kings-Kovalchuk Wearing the Crown in LA? The Aftermath of the 1st Round Loss

Now that my Kings are out of the playoffs(don't get me started) and my period of mourning has expired it is time for me to start posting my picks again. (On a side-note i think the Kings exit from the playoffs, while shorter than anticipated, gives me great hope for next year, for a number of reasons: 1) i believe their run has solidified their top players/core and 2) energized the city and brought the Kings back on the map 3) because of the previous points i believe Kovalchuk will be arriving in LA LA land soon. He stated that his free agency will "short" and thus is implied that he has a suitor which I believe to be the Kings. Frolov is gone and so is O'Donnell and they have have a great young squad and its LA! so why wouldn't he want to play here? Also there is a Fire Sale going on @ LA Live (the online store of the Kings) which leads me to believe they are in the mist if overhauling their uniforms( yuck! good riddance get rid of that purple: what was wrong with the black and silver? or black and white?) In my opinion they are gearing up for a marketing strategy; new uniforms, new energy to the team, publicity in order to rejuvenate the Kings franchise which flirted with success this year, but was just missing a few few parts. Towards the end of the season (last 1/2) Staples Center was the place to be; and not just for Laker games. The crowd was into it: it was a great atmosphere and I think management acknowledged this and sees what the future could be. Thus what better than to complement this new plan then to bring in the sharpshooter Kovalchuk? He would compliment Kopitar, unlike Frolov whom has failed to live up to expectations(even on a free agency year none the less!) Need to wrap this tirade up because i need to post some picks; but look out for the Kings next year: I am envisioning new uniforms, a new sharpshooter(and perhaps defenseman) and continued success past the 1st round.
