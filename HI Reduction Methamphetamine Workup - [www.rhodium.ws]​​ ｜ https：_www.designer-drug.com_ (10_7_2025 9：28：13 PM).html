<b>The Post Reaction Workup:</b>
</p>
<p>
This post assumes you have just completed an HI reduction of ephedrine
or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. Perhaps you arrived here by the
use of red phosphorous and iodine, whether by push-pull, balloon, or
reflux methods; by hypophoshorous acid and iodine, open or closed,
safe or unsafe; the phosphorous acid synth or by the use of HI alone
or with a little red phosphorous added to keep the concentration where
you want it.&nbsp; This writeup centers on the typical HI/ red
Phosphorous reaction, and some of the comments do not apply to hypo or
phosphorous acid synths.&nbsp; You have your honey, which is freebase
meth in an acidic solution that is what is left of the precursors you
started with, the meth produced, and the byproducts of the reaction.
That's where this post <b><i>starts.</i></b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Are you finished?:</b>&nbsp; Your reaction flask is full of larger
bubbles and those small ones you have watched for so long are missing.
When you remove the flask from the heat, and the flask cools enough
the contents cease boiling, you should see no small bubbling activity.
If the smell you already recognize is present add some hot water to
the flask. If you are not too sure about the smell, add a little hot
water, careful not to flood the reaction out. (Geez adds as much hot
water as there is fluid in the flask at this point if the smell is
right.) The red phosphorous should fall out of the solution right
away.&nbsp; When the flask cools just enough for the convection
currents to cease, swirl the flask and watch how fast the red
phosphorous falls to the bottom. If it stays in suspension or does not
completetly settle, or if the red slowly drifts to the bottom and the
fluid is reddish orange, put it back on the hot plate and let it cook
some more. Hoping all you want that it is really finished will not
help you at all if it is not. If the signs are not there, have
patience and let the reaction continue until it completes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If you swirl the flask and the red will settle falls to the bottom
like bricks, your reaction should be considered as finished. The
reaction fluid should ideally be almost clear, just a light tint of
pale yellow. If can be dark gold, beer colored, or even bright piss
yellow. Those colors tell you that contaminants are present. If the
fluid is reddish-orange, but the red phosphorous falls like bricks to
the bottom, you likely have an excess of iodine present in the
reaction fluid. Some like to add a single crystal of sodium
thiosulfate, which will rapidly clear the iodine from the solution.
Sodium thiosulfate can also be found in the aquarium area of the big
retail stores as a liquid used to remove chlorine from water. A drop
if sufficient.&nbsp; You can also just let the fluid in the flask
boil, condenser removed, for ten or fifteen mintues; this will clear
excess iodine without using sodium thiosulfate.
</p>
<p>
<i>Fine Filtering </i> Dilute the fluid in the flask with an equal
volume of hot dH<sub>2</sub>O. Swirl until the red is in the fluid and
 quickly pour the fluid through a filter. You will not get all the
 red phosphorous the first time. Add more water, swirl, repeat the
 process. You may find it helps to hold the flask upside down as
 you cease swirling (with a stopper in the opening of course) so
 the red phos will be washed out. Rinse the flask again with
 near-boiling water. Rinse the red phosphorous filtered out while
 it is in the filter with additional hot water. The goal of
 filtering is to get the red phosphorous out of the fluid. Some
 particles are very small and difficult to filter out without
 proper filter paper.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Filters that work:&nbsp; The preferred method is to use a Buchner
funnel with vacuum, and if you have one, you know how to use it.&nbsp;
If you do not have a Buchner funnel, take a funnel (do not crimp the
process by using the smallest one you can find...be generous
here...use one big enough to hold all of what&nbsp; you plan to filter
if you can.&nbsp; Gravity filtration is usually done by pressing two
or three cotton balls in the neck of the funnel (not too tightly, but
tight enough to catch what red gets by the filters) and putting a
fluted filter paper into the funnel. Wet any filter papers and cotton
balls with water before pouring the honey into the filter. Coffee
filters are an often used substittute for filter paper. The problem
with coffee filters is that they are no fine enough for this job, and
they trap some red phosphorous in the filter fibers.&nbsp; A fourth
method (and Geez' personal favorite) is the "Charmin Plug."
This is basically a tapered paper plug for the neck of the funnel,
which can be compressed if needed to filter even finer and finer
particles. To make a&nbsp; Charmin plug,&nbsp; take a single square of
unscented Charmin toilet paper, fold it over itself lengthwise twice,
or roll it up in a tube about a half inch wide, then roll it like
joint. Roll it with a taper so one end is larger than the opening in
the neck of the funnel.&nbsp; It should be 2 -3 cm long and a little
thicker than the neck of the funnel. Press the rolled plug loosely
into the neck of the funnel. Pour a little water through it and adjust
the density of the plug by pushing it gently into the neck until you
have a steady drip of water, one drop right after another. You can
aedjust it for a fine, thin stream and often this will be perfect; the
steady drip seems to remove more of the very fine fine particles or
red phosphorous, however. Do not use a filter on top of this, and do
not lay tissues flat in the bottom of the funnel.
</p>
<p>
The beauty of the&nbsp; Charmin plug is that the red phosphorous
particles settle in the funnel and on the top of the plug, where it
can be tapped into a big pile in a drying dish.&nbsp; Most of the red
phosphorous on the plug can be wiped off the end of the plug; The
first 3 or 4 mm of the plug will have red phosphorous embedded in it;
tear this part of the plug off and save these in a jar. When the time
comes to clean used red phosphorous with an acid bath, these can be
added to the hot acid, which will destroy the paper and the paper
fibers, leaving mainly a little ash and most of the red phosphorous.
Dilute H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> works very well for this. Geez usually saves
 the plugs until he is either out of red or has a full jar of
 plugs.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;<i>Never stir toilet paper with red phosphorous on it in
 water.</i> Some folks like to lay a piece of Charmin flat in the
funnel. Geez does not do this. You can only separate red phos from the
paper when the paper is dry; you can do this with a soft brush very
effectively. You cannot do it effectively from a whole sheet of paper.
As this paper is made to fall apart in water, it does. It
<i>really</i> does if you stir the water. This leaves all the fiber
and its a big mess, and you do not want the paper fiber mixed with the
red. It gets in the way and is a drag on the reaction. You can burn
the paper out in an acid bath, but it is a better solution to avoid
having to do so at all.
</p>
<p>
Swirl the contents of the flask and pour them into the funnel. You may
need to add additional hot water to swirl, and reduce it to a small
enough quantity that it can all be dumped in the funnel at one
time.&nbsp; (Some prefer not to worry with getting the red phosphorous
out of the flask at this point, and use sufficient water to rinse the
methamphetamine from the red phosphorous. The red phosphorous is
allowed to dry in the flask, where it may remain for the next
reaction, or where it may be knocked loose and come out as powder. You
need to know the clean weight of the flask if you plan to leave the
phosphorous in the flask.)
</p>
<p>
When all your honey has dripped into the receiving flask, run it
through the filter one more time. If you are using a Charmin Plug, use
a new plug for this filtration. If not using a Charmin plug, filter
through the red again. The additional filtering has benefits. Some of
the red phosphorous is <i>very</i> fine, and you do want it out of
your honey; the second filtration will get more red than you thought
was in the fluid. If you filter through the red phosphorous already
collection, you also filter out iodine in the fluid; likely not all of
it, but some of it. The cleaner the better.
</p>
<p>
After the honey has filtered through the red phosphorous the second
time, wash the red with very hot distilled water. Hot water seems to
work better for this purpose than cool water.&nbsp; Wash until the
unique meth smell is no longer present in the filters and red
phosphorous, or at least until the smell is&nbsp; very faint. You do
not want to unnecessarily thin the honey out so much the volume
becomes a problem for the extraction, but you do want a much more
dilute fluid than you have when the reaction completes. Diluting the
reaction fluid it to about three times its original volume seems to
work well. If you do not dilute at least that much, basing will
produce too many solids and make the extraction difficult. Dilute much
further than that and you make the extraction more difficult.
</p>
<p>
<b> The Non-polar solvent wash of&nbsp; filtered honey.</b> How do you
wash honey? With a non-polar solvent.&nbsp; This step may be the one
single most effective cleaning technique of the post reaction process.
Skip it at your peril!&nbsp; Put the honey in a separatory funnel (or
ghetto equivalent) and add an equal part of non-polar solvent. Choice
of solvent is up to the individual, but Geez likes to use xylene for
two such washes, hot naptha for one (since he extracts twice into
naptha). He will shake the sep funnel with the solvent in it, not
violently, but enough to mix it well. After shaking well, let the
fluids settle and separate out the non-polar solvent. <i>If you had a
 dirty reaction, you probalby picked up orange solids, trash, and
 cloudy masses of whatever that might happen to be-- do not be
 concerned--- you do not want this stuff. Your&nbsp; product is
 safely inside that aqueous reaction fluid and cannot be persuaded
 to jump to the non-polar until you base the solution and strip
 that salt off of the meth molecule. You are [i]not</i> going to
rinse the goods out with non-polar solvents. [/i] So, do it again. Any
more trash come out? Do it again. In fact, keep doing it until the
solvent is clean. You will most likely continue to see cloudy
non-polar solvent with a yellowish coloration after such a wash.
Wash&nbsp; until the solvent is clear. TCE&nbsp; is also very useful
at this point. Use smaller volumes of TCE than you would other
solvents; do not shake the sep funnel or you will have an emulsion
that will need fifteen minutes or so the break down. Turning the
funnel end to end slowly will do the job quite well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
If your honey was bright yellow, or if it was particularly dirty and
the non-polar solvent continued to extract yellow tint from it, you
have some contaminant like PEG in the fluid. Some bees will bring the
honey to a boil in the flask with non-polar solvent present, and
report that this appears to eliminate PEG.&nbsp; The logic behind
boiling the contents of the flask is apparent. Hot solvents clean
better and boiling the fluid makes certain there is enough convection
in the flask to expose all the fluid to the solvent. Experience with
pill extraction suggests five mintues is probably sufficient time for
the non-polar to absorb what it will; if it is saturated with trash,
one may always follow with another boil.
</p>
<p>
<i>Which solvent to use?</i> Geez suggests using an agressive solvent
like xylene or tolulene; he has had a couple of bad experiences with
odorless mineral spirits not separating from the honey and for that
reason does not use mineral spirits for this purpose. Use the solvent
you will extract the meth with at least once, and if it is used first,
use it for two washes. Geez extracts with VM&amp;P naptha most of the
time, and always does at least one wash with hot naptha.&nbsp; Washing
the reaction fluid with the solvent used to extract will remove
anything in the fluid that is soluble in that solvent, which means it
will not be in the fluid to be extracted with the meth. This logically
translates to cleaner meth.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you plan to "ker
plunk" -- or extract with hot naptha, Coleman's fuel, or
equivalent-- <i>wash with <b>hot</b> naptha, Coleman's fuel, or
 equivalent</i> at least one time. Even if you will extract with
naptha, this poster recommends washing the reaction fluid with
tolulene or xylene prior to washing with naptha; there is no reason to
use mineral spirits or naptha to wash if you will extract with
tolulene or xylene, except for economic reasons.
</p>
<p>
Patience: when you do these washes, don't be in such a hurry you don't
give the solvent time to work. Leave that first wash in the sep funnel
for five or ten minutes after shaking the two together. The difference
in what you find in the solvent after a short wait will convince you
the wait is worth doing, and remind you that patience pays.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Steam distillation or solvent extraction?</b>&nbsp; At this point
you will proceed to do an acid/base extraction or steam distillation
of the soon-to-be-freebase metamphetamine.
</p>
<p>
 If you elect to steam distill,&nbsp; the chances are you are not
 reading this anyway, but if you are, refer to this excellent
 write-up of that procedure:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=310129#Post310129" target=_blank>VideoEditor: "Easiest Post Rxn Steam &amp; Clean

</p>
<p>
 If you will do a conventional acid/base extraction, and are
 unfamiliar with acid/base extractions, please review the sticky

</p>
<p>
Transfer your reaction fluid in a separatory funnel (or ghetto
equivalent). Add the non-polar solvent you have selected to use to
extract the methamphetamine. The amount to use is dependent on the
quantity of methamphetamine you will extract and on the
characteristics of the solvent you will use. Standard procedure is to
extract three times with equal volumes of solvent.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>The volume of solvent</b> is more dependent on the quantity of meth
to extract rather than the volume of the reaction fluid, which
includes the water used to rinse the flask, the red and the
filters.&nbsp; Experience will give you a feel for it. For extractions
of less than one ounce of expected methamphetamine,&nbsp; use at least
three 200 ml volumes of solvent. Use 300 ml volumes if using naptha or
mineral spirits. You want to use enough solvent to collect the
freebase without fully saturating the solvent, but not so much that
you make extraction of the methamphetamine from the non-polar solvent
diffiuclt due to the volume of solvent itself. This poster will
increase the volume of solvent by 100 ml per half ounce of anticipated
methamphetamine yield. That is nothing more than his rule of thumb,
based on his experience, and it will serve as a guide to you until you
develop a feel for the volume you need. Frankly, the poster eyeballs
how many glugs from the can are enough, and maintains that the volume
can be too much, but is not as critical as you might think. There is a
range of acceptable volumes. Try to hit the middle. Too little, you
leave some product behind, too much you waste solvent and risk
diluting the freebase so much you cannot recover it all. You can
always extract another time, a fourth, or fifth time with non-polar
solvent. The 200 ml volume is a suggestion applicable to naptha,
coleman's fuel, charcoal lighter fluid, and xylene. TCE is a very
effective solvent to extract freebase methamphetamine&nbsp; and does
so with about half the volume of the other solvents mentioned. It is
also much more expensive than the other solvents. Remember it will be
the bottom layer in the sep funnel.
</p>
<p>
<b>Basing the reaction fluid.</b> Make a twenty percent solution of
NaOH. This means fill a beaker on fifth full of NaOH, and fill it with
water. Stir it until all the NaOH dissolves. Let it cool. (Do this
before you begin filtering the red phosphorous from the reaction
flask, and you will be fine. When its time to let the reaction fluid
boil off any excess iodine, make up your solution if you have not
already. You do not need cold NaOH solution. You simply want a
solution that has dissolved and completed the reaction NaOH and water
have, which is exothermic, and you want the resulting solution to have
cooled to room temperature before using it.
</p>
<p>
You should have a separatory funnel (or ghetto equivalent) with the
washed reaction fluid in it. Add the non-polar solvent chosen to
extract the freebase methamphetamine unless you choose TCE. TCE should
be added after the reaction fluid is based. The solids that form with
basing have a habit of finding themselves in the TCE layer if it is
present when the base is added. This does not seem to be a problem
when the TCE is added after the base.&nbsp; Add the NaOH solution a
little at a time. Pour it through the non-polar solvent. Swirl the
solution after addition to distribute the NaOH. DO NOT SHAKE. Shaking
just causes emulsions. You have no need to shake the solutions.
Swirling is sufficient for all our purposes here.&nbsp; Watch the NaOH
solution as it enters the reaction fluid. It will immediately turn
milky white, then fade back into transparency. Add a little more NaOH.
The same thing will happen. Continue this process, adding a little
NaOH and swirling. Take some time and give it TLC. There is no reason
to shock it with a massive dose-- you can if you want, sure. If you
are new to A/B extractions, you will want to take repeated pH readings
of the reaction fluid, which is the bottom layer unless you are
extracting with TCE or DCM. The non-polar solvent has no pH. It tells
you nothing to measure it, per se. You are concerned with the pH of
the reaction fluid. Measure the pH of the reaction fluid with a meter,
a pH test strip, cabbage juice, or--gasp---your sense of sight and
smell. Yes, experience helps. To gain that knowledge from experience
you must pay attention to sights and smells of the basing process.
</p>
<p>
Chemists will base to pH 12.8, the point at which methamphetamine HCl
sheds that HCl and becomes freebase methamphetamine, which is
non-polar soluble and insoluble in polar solutions. It will find it
way to the non-polar solvent when the reaction fluid becomes pH
12.8&nbsp; Add NaOH in increments until you reach pH 12.8, testing
with your pH meter.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;If you happen to be a cook instead of a chemist, are out of pH
strips, have a meter that no longer works, or hate the smell of
boiling red cabbage, you can simply base the reaction fluid until it
is well above pH 12.8. Many cooks add base until the reaction fluid
"lye locks." Lye lock is easily undone by the addition of a
little more hot water. No real purpose is served by adding enough base
to lock up, and it may decrease yield by preventing the
methamphetamine from reaching the&nbsp; non-polar solvent.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
When you first add a small splash of&nbsp; NaOH solution to the fluid
it will turn the fluid milky where that splash mixes, then the fluid
will clear again. Continue to add NaOH solution a little at a time
until the reaction fluid goes milky and stays that way. Before it
does, it will go milk white and stay that way for thirty seconds or
so. You are almost there. The next addition of a few ml of NaOH
solution will make it go white and stay white. You may even seen
solids beginning to form. This is not a problem. <b>SMELL THE
 FLASK.</b> Smell that fish market smell? That is the smell of
freebase amines. Learn to love it. When you smell that smell, you are
right where you want to be, regardless of pH. You are getting the
amines. That is what you are after. This is not to be confused with
the lye smell, or the solvent smell. It is a distinctive smell of
three day old dead fish. You will come to love that smell.&nbsp; When
you have milky reaction fluid and smell the fish, your solution is at
least at pH 12.8, and regardless of the precise measure, it is based
strongly enough to freebase the methamphetamine HCl in the fluid.
</p>
<p>
<i>Notes on Extracting the Meth into Nonpolar Solvents:</i>
</p>
<p>
1) SWIRL, and&nbsp; DO NOT SHAKE. There is no reason to shake the
based reaction fluid and the non-polar solvent together. The meth will
migrate to the nonpolar as long as there is a clean interface and some
movement of the fluid. Shaking&nbsp; form emulsions, these emulsions
trap reaction fluid and methamphetamine freebase,&nbsp; keep it from
migrating to the non-polar solvent, and blocks the interface between
the polar and non-polar layers. This results in lower yield.&nbsp;
Swirling is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
2)&nbsp; LET IT SIT. This is not an instant process, even though it
does not take all night. After you hit the magic milky solution, give
it fifteen minutes. Rule of thumb. Not that critical, but don't be in
a big hurry. Give the meth time to migrate to the non-polar solution.
</p>
<p>
3) LATHER, RINSE, REPEAT. Separate out the nonpolar solvent. Save it
in another container. Add fresh non-polar solvent to the separatory
funnel (OGE), let it separate from the reaction fluid. Add a little
more NaOH solution to make sure the fluid does not fall below 12.8.
Chances are it will not.&nbsp; (Note: If you have reason to believe
orange gakk is present, only add&nbsp; more base if the pH is below
12.8.) Swirl. Let the fluids sit together for awhile. Remember the
last time. After the two layers separate completely,&nbsp; separate
out the non-polar solvent. Combine with the first volume of solvent.
<i> Some cooks proceed at this point to a third pull with fresh
 solvent. Geez will add more solvent and leave the fluid for at
 least a day with the solvent. He gets a little better yield this
 way. If you do a third pull right away, you may get a small amount
 of product. If you let the fluid sit overnight, you can often
 double the amount. Patience pays.
</i></p><i>
<p>
4) SHOULD YOU ADD SALT?&nbsp; Many bees, Geez included, will add some
table salt to the reaction fluid after basing.&nbsp; Add until no more
dissolves, but no so much you clog the sep funnel with it.&nbsp; In
theory water is more attracted to NaCl that methamphetamine HCl and
will let go of the meth to get the salt. IS IT TRUE? Who knows? Does
it hurt? Probably not, at least if you don't have emulsions. Should
you use table salt? You can, but you are better served with pulverized
rock salt which will not contain the anti-clogging additive. Better
yet, use pickling salt which does not have the anti-clogging stuff in
it.&nbsp; Table salt may contain iodine in very very small traces and
does not present a real concern in this application.&nbsp; Does the
salt actually increase the yield? I do not know. I have never split a
batch into two equal volumes and extracted one with salt and one
without.
</p>
<p>
5) DOING A THIRD PULL. A third pull should be done just like the first
two were. Add more NaOH solution. Swirl. Let it sit.&nbsp; Geez lets
this one sit overnight (at least) and sometimes a couple of days. You
can shake this one if you want to, since its going to sit long enough
for the emulsion to break down. You are extracting mostly the rogue,
stubborn meth molecules that have not let go sooner, and you should
expect this to take some time. You extracted the better part of your
yield doing the first two extractions. What yield you get from a third
pull is "extra" and it is the stuff that did not want to
come easy Giving it more time makes sense. You may choose to save this
and combine it with the next batch, or do it separately. Depends on
how much of a tweaker you are.
</p>
</i><p><i>
6) WHAT TO DO WITH THE REACTION FLUID.&nbsp; Consider the reaction
fluid spent after three pulls.&nbsp; Save it. Get a big plastic gas
can, etc. and pour it in that can until the can is full. When the jug
gets full, you can extract iodine from it. Geez usually gets about
half his iodine back from the reaction fluid.&nbsp; [i][waste not,
want not.)</i> Whatever you do, keep everything until&nbsp; you have
finished everything. That way, if you misplaced what you want, you
still have it. Be patient, and do not hurry the process.
</p>
<p>
7) ON USING TCE TO EXTRACT METH. Geez notes that the bottom-puller TCE
does an exceptionally good job of extracting freebase meth. It will do
so cleanly if you have washed the reaction fluid with TCE prior to
basing. If you omit the prebasing TCE wash, forget extracting with
TCE. Use TCE if you gas; it does not titrate well. Add the TCE after
you have based the reaction fluid. You can pour it in, but if it comes
in a spray can, just direct the spray right into the based reaction
fluid. Not much swirling required. TCE will make a emulsion of sorts
but this does break down in ten to fifteen mintues in clean fluid.
Give it this time. Do not base with the TCE present in the sep funnel.
The NaOH solution will fall through the aqueous layer and into the
TCE, the float back up. it tends to dump solids in the TCE layer when
it does this. You will not have the problem if you add the TCE to the
based reaction fluid.
</p>
<p>
IF THINGS HAVE GONE WELL TO THIS POINT, YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE DREAMING--
OR HOW TO HANDLE COMMON PROBLEMS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER BY THIS TIME.
</p>
<p>
Any number of misfortunes could have befallen the cook by this time.
The principal problems Geez is personally familiar with are:
</p>
<p>
<b>EMULSIONS:</b> There is no single source of emulsions. Some are
caused by adulterants in the precursors, some may be caused by
anti-caking additives in table salt, some may be caused by ingredients
added to NaOH in OTC lye preparations. Some are caused by residues on
the glassware, including traces of soaps or detergents. Some emulsions
are nothing more than the result of shaking oil and water
together.&nbsp; The most common cause of emulsions is inadequate
cleaning of the precursors, particularly pseudo. Using an effective
extraction technique suited to the source of the precursor is the
first line defense against emulsions. Recrystalizing the pseudo twice
before reacting also tend to remove impurities and make emulsions less
likely. Using NaOH solution rather than dry NaOH to base also helps
avoid emulsions.
</p>
<p>
Other preventive measures include using rock salt or pickling salt
(rather than table salt). Not using soap or detergent to clean the
glassware, and rinsing glassware with acetone after washing help limit
the incidence of emulsions.&nbsp; The next best preventive measure is
to avoid shaking the polar and non polar layers togeher.&nbsp;
Swirling is sufficient. Stirring is permissible. Shaking is asking for
emulsions. Period. You do not need to shake.
</p>
<p>
<b>Combatting emulsions:</b>. There are several ways to combat
emulsions. The first is to <b>let it just sit there</b> until the
emulsion goes away. Another is to take a stick and <b>poke at the
 bubbles.</b> This works only if you are sufficiently wired to want
to do this for twelve hours. Another is to <b>add additional non-polar
 solvent</b> and stir. You may also <b>add a small volume of
 acetone</b> to the solution and stir. This may be exciting...it
may effervesce as you add it. It may do nothing. You may also <b>add a
 little TCE</b> while stirring. This will quickly settle to the
bottom, but has been reported in certain circumstances to have an
effect of breaking an emulsion. The most likely successful method if
waiting alone does not work is to pour all of the reaction fluid,
emulsion and non-polar solvent into a flask or coffee pot or container
that will take heat, and <b>heat it up slowly</b>, stirring
occasionally. Bring the reaction fluid to near boiling, and allow the
non-polar solvent to heat up. While doing this, it may help to <b>salt
 the emulsion</b> with ground rock salt. It may help to <b>add a
 few drops of hydrogen peroxide</b> the the mixture. The poster has
even added drops of 35% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to the mix, which gives a
 violent reaction, which may or may not do anything other than
 cause the non-polar solution to bubble out of the flask, but
 is a diversion to watch. While heating, add some boiling
 stones, broken clay pot pieces, or washed coarse sand to the
 flask to keep it from forming bubbles so large as to displace
 the volume of the container and spray you with the meth-laden
 non-polar solution, rendering all of your efforts a complete
 waste. This phenomenon is referred to as bumping. Do not let
 it destroy your day. It is simple to avoid.&nbsp; One final
 suggestion, used on one occasion by the poster helping a
 friend out of a jam, is to finely powder <b>activated
 carbon</b> and add this to the contents of the boiling
 coffee pot or flask. It will float to the interface. Grind it
 finely, you want it to be fine. Bring the contents to a boil.
 At first it will appear that the carbon is blocking any meth
 from coming to the surface, but as the convection currents in
 the flask increase the carbon will beging to swirl on the top
 layer, and you will be able to see into the reaction fluid
 layer. Boil for ten minutes or so after it reaches this point,
 the let the mixture cool. Separate out the non-polar
 solution. This worked quite well when the emulsion present was
 suspected to be related to glycol and cellulose that was
 contained in the pseudoephedrine being used.
</p>
<p>
If none of the above work, suicide is an effective solution, as is
starting over with clean precursors.
</p>
<p>
<b>Lye lock and other such ideas</b> Lye lock is the state which the
reaction fluid reaches when the cooling reaction fluid is saturated
with NaOH and thickens. The author has experienced something along
this line once or twice. If you encounter such an event, heat the
solution slowly, or add hot water to it and stir.
</p>
<p>
<b>You got ahead of yourself and added HCl to the sep funnel.</b> <i>
 Stranger things have happened.</i> Add more water, add more NaOH
solution. That is all. If you can acidify the based reaction fluid to
recover I<sub>2</sub>, you can base the acid in the reaction fluid to raise
 the pH.
</p>
<p>
<b>Ker Plunking -- the variation on the Acid/Base extraction.
 </b>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=59240#Post59240" target=_blank>Worlock: "Ker Plunking for quality and quantity"
 (Stimulants)</a>
</p>
<p>
Ker Plunking-- whether it is all that it is advertised to be or not--
does in fact provide an efficient way to perform an acid/base
extraction of methamphetamine from the reaction fluid. While it is
principally a way of heating the naptha used to collect the meth
freebase to increase its solvency, the process also entails heating to
combat emulsions, and a slow basing process which allows one to watch
the process and visually determine that the freebase is eluting to the
non-polar solvent, and to maximize that process by cues derived from
the addition of base, salt, stirring, and heating. When the bubbles
are eluting and are obvious and numerous, stop addition, turn the heat
off an wait fifteen minutes. Separate the naptha from the reaction
fluid.&nbsp; In the poster's experience, your yield, if you did this
properly and with sufficient naptha (count on 500 ml per ounce of
meth) will come in the first pull. (The poster is in the habit of
letting the reaction fluid cool, adding a little more base to it,
salting it a little, adding xylene, sealing the container, and letting
it sit. He will return and extract from the xylene a day or two later,
sometimes a week later. The second pull is usually worth doing, will
yield an average of ten percent or so of the initial yield, and is
usually used as fuel to power the cook through another reaction.)
</p>
<p>
For those who lack experience with the ker plunking technique, please
read the intital thread, remember to use boiling stones or equivalent
and do a second pull. Extract the second pull separately. You may come
to the poster's conclusion about the need to do it twice. You should,
however, satisfy yourself in this regard before deciding to skip a
second pull.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>A short synthesis of geezmeister's view of the Ker Plunk:</b>
<i>(Not a rewriteup, nor a writeup, but some short notes on the
 process for the newbee too impatient to follow the links and read
 the whole thread.)&nbsp; You have you non-polar washed honey in a
 flask. A large Erhlenmeyer is fine, so is a coffee pot. Geez likes
 a white corningware coffee percolater pot, about ten inches deep
 and four in inner diameter. Regardless of you choice of vessel,
 add your honey. Add boiling stones, broken crockery, or washed
 coarse sand, and [i] (do not overlook to do this under penalty of
 losing your whole batch to a big "bump," having a fire,
 bringing in the fire department who will notify law
 enforcement...get the picture....this is important!)</i> Add VM&amp;P
naptha or Coleman's fuel or generic camp fuel. Naptha is the trick,
here. Add heat slowly. As the reaction mixture starts to warm, you
will notice gakk, if it is present, at the interface. If you have
gakk, the heating itself will help, but you may also add a few drops
at a time of peroxide. Three percent solution should be used, if any.
There is dispute regarding whether this process is worth the time of
trouble. No one has posted any side by side test results to determine
whether it is or is not. HOWEVER, Geez says it never seemed to hurt,
even when it was 35% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which should only be added by
 fools, idiots, and those who just like to see things violently
 bubble as if all hell were breaking loose. Some folks believe
 this assists in breaking down certain gakks. Results, at best,
 are inconclusive. Other thing one might care to add to the pot
 include a few drops of alcohol, supposedly to keep the NaOH
 you will add out of the non-polar, but since you are going to
 wash it later, this too appears to be an old wive's tale of
 unproven efficacy. Add sodium hydroxide. A little at a time.
 NaOH, RDL, whatever you wish to call it. If you add it dry, it
 will sink to the bottom and have a violent little reaction. It
 will also react when you stir it, and if you add too
 much--guess what--you can blow all the naptha right out of the
 pot. Other than just liking the reaction and activity, Geez
 sees little benefit in adding dry NaOH to the pot. He adds a
 20% solution, a little at a time. He stirs after each
 addition. Let the heat come up slowly to where the rection
 fluid is just bubbling. All the while, add a little NaOH, a
 little more, a little more. You can measure the pH of the
 reaction fluid at each addition, every now and then, or not at
 all. Your choice. Geez likes to stop adding before it all gets
 milky and stays that way, and add some rock salt, a tablespoon
 or so, to the pot. No, no need to grind it up. It will
 dissolve. What doesn't is excess and will help prevent
 bumping. (As before, the addition of salt is a maybe yes,
 maybe no, old wive's tale sort of thing. Rock salt never
 seemed to hurt a thing. Table salt--that can be different,
 and you should avoid it since it probably has iodine in
 quantities too small to matter but anti-caking ingredients
 that may help emulsions form). Continue stirring, allow the
 temp of the naptha to rise. If you have a serious emulsion (
 which is an indication your pseudo was less than clean) and it
 has not responded to anything else, add some ground activated
 charcoal. This will float to the interface layer. Stir, bring
 the temperature of the reaction fluid up to boiling slowly.
 Observe the convection currents in the reaction fluid maing
 the carbon roil in the pot. Keep it there at least five
 minutes. Then..while stirring add more NaOH a little at a time
 until you <i>have it right. </i>
</p>
<p>
<b>How to tell you<i> have it right:</i></b> 1) measure the pH of the
reaction fluid, and confirm that it is pH 12.8 or higher. Higher is
likely better, just as a matter of being excessive about all things
(the late appearance of orange gakk may have rendered excessively high
pH counterproductive.) 1) watch the bottom layer go white, stay white
and begin to elute small bubbles, like the fizz when you pour soda,
only not so intense. 3) Smell the fish market smell and see the
bubbles. This is Geez's method, since he is doing this in a non-glass
pot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, after you have it right, add just a bit more NaOH, let the
bubbles really start eluting up, and turn the heat off. Leave it alone
for at least fifteen minutes. When it finishes releasing the small
bubbles to the non-polar layer and has cooled off a little bit, you
are done. Decant or separate the naptha. If you wish to pull again
(recommended) do so now. No need to add more of anything, just bring
the naptha up to temp, let setle, and separate. Do three if you
insist. With ker plunking, a third pull is usually a formality only.
</p>
<p>
<b>Point of convergence</b> For those of you who just returned here
after steam distilling the freebase and have now dissolved it in
non-polar solvent, you are where we are here, only with what is
probably a cleaner mixture of meth and non-polar solvent. For the A/B
er's, and the Ker Plunker's, we meet again at this point.
</p>
<p>
<b>What to do with the reaction fluid.</b> Pouring it out is not a
viable solution. It is full of idodides. You can in fact recover
I<sub>2</sub> from the reaction fluid. It is there. It can be recovered. <a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=188836#Post188836" target=_blank>Worlock: "Sodium Iodide recovery"
 (Stimulants)</a> If you do not care to do so, please take the
 time to neutralize the solution with acid, or at least dilute with
 lots of tap water, so as not to pollute the entire universe and
 give meth cooks a bad name with the DEQ.
</p>
<p>
<b> Extracting the meth from the non-polar solvent</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>washing the solvent</b>. Yes. Washing the solvent pays dividends.
Use distilled water. (Yes, sure, you can actually use tap water or
spring water or creek water if you want to...but distilled water is
inexpensive and meth is not. So buy some distilled water and use that.
Tap water will get you by if you must, but you run the risk of
contamination with additives and minerals in the water. Your choice.
Distilled water is seriously recommended here.)&nbsp; Put the
non-polar solvent/meth solution in the separatory funnel (OGE) and add
warm distilled water. Geez uses about a fourth as much water as he has
non-polar solvent. Shake this as though your very life depended on it
being shaken. Then let it sit. Remember the thing about
patience?&nbsp; Here is another point where it will pay. Let the wash
water settle out completely. The last stuff that falls out is the
dirtiest you get. That is why you should wait about ten to fifteen
minutes after the first wash, if you can make yourself. Separate out
the rinse water, and save it. Add cool water, same quantity, and wash.
Same shaking. Look at it as it settles. Feel it when you separate it
out. If you continue to see cloudy material you need to continue
washing. If it feels slick and oily, it still needs washing.
</p>
<p>
<i>the lye solution wash</i>If after these two washings the wash water
is noticeably cloudy, or if the water is slick, you should proceed to
do a lye wash. Use a pre-prepared twenty percent solution, one quarter
the volume of the non-polar solution, and shake like hell again. Allow
to settle, separate out, and follow at once with a warm distilled
water wash. You will find the lye wash will clear sodium ions out the
non-polar and will clean it of the lye remnants that may be in it from
the A/B or ker plunk. Sounds like nonsense, works like magic. Do not
be afraid of it, and remember NaOH is cheap compared to trash in your
product.
</p>
<p>
<i>brine wash</i> A very good wash with much the same benefits as the
lye solution wash is the brine wash...a wash with salt-saturated hot
water. This wash also provides a benefit in helping dry the non-polar
solvent if you will gas.
</p>
<p>
<i>temperature of washes</i> Geez does hot lye solution or hot brine
solution first, warm water second, room temp water third. Why? Hell,
he got in the habit of doing it that way for some reason. Seems to
work. May even be some science to it, Geez does not know.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cautions in washing.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can wash with water alone.
Conventional wisdom is to never let the ph of the wash water fall
below pH 9 or 10 while doing this, as you supposedly start losing
product. Geez thinks this is nonsense, but never tosses out his rinse
water until he finishes up and determines he did not, in fact, throw
the baby out with the wash water. And he has done an A/B extraction of
the rinse water alone and recovered more than a gram of meth from it
(one ounce reaction). This says you can in fact wash out some of the
goodies. So don't toss the wash water until you are through. Note that
the use of NaOH solution wash will avoid the problem with the pH of
the water falling, will rid the mix of NaOH residues and excess sodium
ions, and make the washes more complete.
</p>
<p>
Now you are ready to extract. How do you wish to proceed?&nbsp;
Options are to gas, or extract with an aqueous solution of
hydrochloric acid. A third method is to accumulate hydrogen chloride
gas in alcohol, and add that to the non-polar. The author has never
observed this method, let alone used it, and if you are interested,
you will have to UTFSE.
</p>
<p>
<b>On Gassing:</b>&nbsp; Dry your washed non-polar solvent and
freebase meth solution before gassing. As to producing the gas, I
recommend you review the following: <a href=http://www.rhodium.ws/chemistry/hclgas.argox.html target=_blank>http://www.rhodium.ws/chemistry/hclgas.argox.html</a>;
<a href=http://www.rhodium.ws/chemistry/hcl-gas.html target=_blank>http://www.rhodium.ws/chemistry/hcl-gas.html</a>;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=34296#Post34296" target=_blank>LaBTop: "Re: DETAILED METHODS for NON-CHEMISTS"
 (Newbee Forum)</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=265010#Post265010" target=_blank>VideoEditor: "New Clean Gassing Method!" (Newbee
 Forum)</a> Geez, when he gasses, uses the VideoEditor gassing
apparatus as modified by Dwarfer...the Damp Rid/HCl generator with an
aquarium airpump...and could not be happier with it. He gasses with
the tip all the way down in the solution, since with this method there
is no moisture or suck-back. He filters when the mix gets thoroughly
cloudy but before is gets thick like applesauce. Part of this is his
choice of solvents when he gasses (TCE) and its particular drying
characteristics.
</p>
<p>
Gassing is usually performed by placing the tip of the hose or wand
from the gas generator just a fraction of an inch above the surface of
the non-polar solvent, so that the gas being emitted contacts the
surface of the non-polar solvent and the force of the gas flow pushes
it down slightly. Bubblng the gas through the solvent is advocated by
some proponents of gassing and condemned by others. The non-polar
solvent may, but will not necessarily snow crystals. Ususally the
solvent will thicken and look like applesauce. The solvent&nbsp; will
have to be filtered through a filter and the filtrate allowed to dry.
</p>
<p>
If the gas is not dried prior to application in the non-polar your
meth will disappear in the water; if you see that yellow nasty stuff
at the bottom of the jar, do not despair. Separate it and evaporate it
as you would if you titrated.
</p>
<p>
<b> On titrating</b> Okay, so you can tell Geez primarily extracts his
meth with aqueous HCl and evaporates.&nbsp;&nbsp; People who know a
great deal more about chemistry than Geez call this method titration,
which has to do in this instance with adding an acid to a basic
solution in such a manner as to bring the pH of the solution to
neutral, or slightly acidic pH. Your freebase methamphetaimine is
dissolved in a non-polar solvent. Under basic conditions,
methamphetamine will be and remain&nbsp; freebase, with no HCl
molecule attached. Under neutral to acidic conditions it will bond
with a HCl molecule and form a salt, which is water soluble. The
methamphetamine HCl will disassociate from the non-polar solvent and
dissolve in the aqueous HCl; this water/acid mixture is insoluble in
the non-polar solvent, will separate from it in a layer that may
drained from the separatory funnel, thus collecting the
methamphetamine HCl in an aqueous solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The pH level is very important to chemists. It is also rather tricky,
as the pH level at either end of the scale rises or drops at a
different rate relative to the addition of the acid or base than it
does in the middle range of the scale. It will take more acid to go
from pH 13 to ph 10 than it will to go from ph 10 to ph 7. It takes
little more than a drop to go from pH 7 to pH 5. Two drops more and
the pH may fall to 3.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Geez always gets the feeling that pH 7 is like a street sign on a
highway-- he's past it before he realizes it.&nbsp; In Geez's
experience the meth does not take on the HCl neatly at pH 7.0, which
is pretty&nbsp; much a good thing, for it did he would never have
recovered his final product. It starts before you get to pH 7.0 and
continues if you go below pH 7.0. MOST of it happens around pH 7.0.
You want to get there. You can add water and do what the chemists do,
which is add acid drop by drop, checking pH as it their lives and meth
depended on it. This may be an advisable and worthwhile
characteristic, but I suggest that it is an unnecessary one in this
particular application. If you go overboard and get the pH way too low
you will still get most of your product, you can clean it, and you can
grow crystals. You are going to have some nasties in that last pull
you would not otherwise have, sure...and you may cost yourself some
yield. Geez has seen folks toss straight HCl in the non-polar solvent
by the shotglass, shake it like hell, vent it to release pressure,
shake some more, separate it out, and evaporate it. They get good
product for the first two times they do it. Their third pull sure
stinks, and the product from it is usually really dirty. These folks
have never seen a pH strip, let alone a meter. WizardX gave some
advice a long time back on this board to toss a few drops of HCl in
water, toss it in the non-polar and shake well, then evaporate it.
Keep evaporating each such pull by itself until you either get no more
meth or the stuff you gets is so dirty its not worth messing with.
Toss the dirty stuff back in the mix the next time around.&nbsp; It
was sound advice, particularly for the cook without strips or a meter.
It works. A never-measure-the-pH meth extraction. You can run into
some cleanup problems if you toss that third pull in with the other
two. In Geez' experience, that was where the dirty stuff came in, and
is one of the reasons why he evaps the first two pulls separately from
the last one. All the same, it works. The folks who toss in acid in by
the shot glass wonder how Geez uses the same gallon of acid as long as
he does. He agrees their product is on the same level as his...he just
goes a hell of a lot easier on the acid. If they can pour it in like
that, hitting the right pH is overemphasized.
</p>
<p>
Newbees probably should not leave it to chance. I do not recommend
that you never use pH strips or a meter,&nbsp; that you never learn
how to boil red cabbage and use the extract. Those are all wise things
to do. All the same, no newbee should despair when his water in that
non-polar he extracted his honey with suddenly bottoms out on the pH
scale. Geez learned the how-to part of it before he ever got
acquainted with pH strips that measured&nbsp; high enough, ever had pH
meter, or ever boiled red cabbage. There are sights and smells and
pressures and changes you note to tell there is enough. It is not a
life or death game of pH levels as far as the meth is concerned.&nbsp;
You can over do it, and you learn not to. You can do it by touch and
look and look and smell and not overdo it either. Its a lot like any
AB process: you get a feel for it, a touch, a nose, whatever--- you
learn where in that one quarter of a turn it becomes tight enough, or
here, where the pH is low enough, to accomplish the purpose. And you
learn by experience that dry acetone can be your best friend and that
acetone jar you save your rinsew acetone in your salvation when you
overdo it. That isn't chemist logic at all. But it works for cooks.
</p>
<p>
If you want the cream of batch, toss ten drops of acid in a 75 ml of
dH<sub>2</sub>O and pour that into your non-polar solvent/meth solution in
 the separatory funnel. Shake like hell. Then shake some more, and
 when you are done, shake it again. Shake it like it meant
 something, because it does. Drain this out and evaporate it
 separately. Hey, so what if the pH is 8. You will already have
 some meth. Add another batch of water and acid, the pH falls more,
 you get more meth in the next pull. <i>This is why most folks get
 the bigger yield on the second pull-- they have finally
 neutralized the mix</i>.
</p>
<p>
Normally, you will collect the three volumes of non-polar solvent used
to extract the meth from the reaction fluid, and will "pull"
this three times with water and acid. It is not critical how much
water you use. Use enough, but meth is so soluble in water that a ml
of water per gram of meth is probably enough. Use more, get it all, do
not try to collect it saturated. You will evaporate it anyway. On a
one ounce batch-- where Geez expects 28 grams or so of meth, he
extracts with three volumes of 125 ml each. He has done it with less,
down to 50 ml, and more (which was a waste of time).
</p>
<p>
It is very important to shake each volume of aqueous HCl in the
non-polar as though your life depended on it. Chanting and speaking
incantations are regarded by chemists as primative superstitions and
by meth cooks as humorous ways of passing off the tedium of shaking
the solution. <i>Try chanting some time, it might surprise you how
 well it works</i>. Chemists like to collect these three volumes of
water/acid and evaporate them.&nbsp; Geez likes to combine the first
two and evaporate them, then evaporate the third one separately. He
does this because he frequently gets too low on the pH, has some extra
nasties in the last extraction, and likes to save steps cleaning most
of his product. The first two pulls will be cleaner. Your choice, as
it all cleans easily enough. Besides, by this point in time he has
already sampled some of the cream of the crop and has the will and
desire to do all manner of unnecessary things.
</p>
<p>
<b>If the pH falls too low</b> Geez again says this does not happen.
You can add water, base it with NaOH and send it back to fresh
non-polar solvent, and do it again, but the chances are you will lose
product in the process and will have a lower yield than you would if
you just cleaned the product you obtain. If you must hit it just
perfect, do this. Understand, you really are placing the pH in a
neutral position to allow the freebase to bond with the HCl molecule.
When you evaporate the water/acid solution, you are going to
concentrate the acid anyway. It is not that acidity hurts the meth
HCl, it does not. It may introduce other contaminants to the water
mix. These will need to be cleaned, but this is not difficult to do.
Geez suggests the easiest approach to not overshooting pH 6.8-7.0 is
taking the advice of Worlock or WizardX to use larger batches of
water, add a little acid to each batch, and do multiple pulls (five or
more) and evaporate each separately. You will know when you fell below
pH 7.0, as the odor of evaporating HCl will burn your nostrils and you
will learn the value of a fume hood. You will also find that if you
follow this method, your chances of contaminating the whole batch with
some nasty creation that resulted from over-basing the mix are much
reduced.
</p>
<p>
<b>Evaporating</b> This should be done on low heat, in a visionware
bowl, or flat pyrex dish, on a hotplate or with heat lamps, with an
exhaust fan exhausting fumes to the outdoors, and with a fan blowing
over the top of the dish. Too much heat will result in loss of yield
as some of the meth vaporizes with the heat. Patience pays. If you
have to have some now, evaporate that first pull by itself, then do
the rest. Do it slowly. It will form a skin, or crust, as it
evaporates, and will skin over before it fully dries. Try to let it
dry without building up on the sides of the dish.&nbsp; Before it is
completely dry, flood the dish with dried acetone. This technique is
called "acetone flashing" and will not only rid the dish of
its remaining water content, it will precipitate methamphetamine hcl
crystals in the acetone.
</p>
<p>
For tips on acetone flashing: <a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=238802#Post238802" target=_blank>geezmeister: "Re: Acetone Crashing"
 (Stimulants)</a> While this post addresses flashing
pseudoephedrine, it holds true for methamphetamine as
well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Geez recommends letting the bowl settle down and
cool down, then slyly tilting the pan so the meth stays in one place
and the acetone slips to another. Then you can just pour the acetone
into a beaker, and not have to pour it through a filter. Filters
absorb a lot of product. If you must use a filter and have a Buchner
funnel, now is the time to use it. If you don't, you can pour the
acetone--and meth-- through a coffee filter and let it gravity filter.
Rinse with a little fresh acetone, particularly if you used too much
acid. Place the filter aside to air dry, or heat with gentle heat. If
you panned the acetone aside, leave the meth in the glass dish to
dry.&nbsp; If the meth is anything other than sparkling and white,
rinse the meth in fresh acetone. Do this in the dish if you have
panned the meth to one side, or rinse the meth in the filter with
fresh dry acetone. Do dry the acetone before use, and do save all the
rinse acetone-- particularly the acetone used to flash when the dish
is still warm.
</p>
<p>
Put the acetone poured off after flashing in a beaker, cover, and
place this in the freezer. You can add the acetone used to rinse to
this. Give this time to chill and pin crystals of methamphetamine will
form. You may filter these or return them to a glass dish to pan and
separate the acetone. Save the acetone, it still has gold in it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cleaning the methamphetamine HCl</b> The product you have is
probably usable as it is. It also can be cleaned further by rinsing
with fresh acetone. True cleaning calls for recyrstalization.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of good threads on dual solvent recrystaliziation.
The basic principle is to dissolve the methamphetamine HCl in boiling
alcohol, filter through a fine filter to remove trash, reduce to
saturation, and combine with another solvent such as dry acetone. Let
the temperature fall slowly and give it some time and meth crystals
will form. You will find these to be much cleaner than the meth you
started with. A good descriptive writeup can be found in <a href="https://www.the-hive.ws/forum/showflat.pl?Cat=&amp;Number=365131#Post365131" target=_blank>Chicken: "Step by Step Recrystallization of
 Meth" (Stimulants)</a> although there are plenty of others.

*********************************************************

<p>
The object of this post was to do a basic, if fairly comprehensive,
post-reaction workup post for meth cooks. I have no doubt omitted any
and all information having to do with the question which prompted you
to read this post in the first place. This is, of course, proof
positive that the universe is as it is supposed to be, and that no
good deed will go unpunished. For very long, at least. No doubt there
are those among you who will take issue at part of this post, which is
as it should be; I only intended&nbsp; by this post to centralize in
some way the process of leaning for the new bee intent on making meth.
If I have succeeded in that respect, I have accomplished what I sought
to accomplish.----- Geez
