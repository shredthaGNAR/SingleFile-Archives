(self.LocalLLaMA)submitted 12 hours ago by DrVonSinistroI use it to code a important (to me) project. In fact I'm done mostly but Llama 3 is surprisingly updated with .NET 8.0 knowledge so I'm refactoring. For some reason I thanked it for its outstanding work and it started asking me questions about what we're doing. 
Its uncanny the way it understand my goal and my approaches. It ask further details of aspects of what I'm explaining. To be honest, it 1000% feels like a real dev is tricking me and took control of the LLM and is typing the questions. 
«Start new chat» feels like murder.

Download[–]baes_thm 11 points12 points13 points 5 hours ago (1 child)Forget the 405B, the 70B feels GPT-4-class today, at least in some things. It doesn't quite know as much, but I have found its explanations to be more logical, coherent, and human than anything else I've ever used. This model has basically killed everything else for me

Download[–]DrVonSinistro[S] 9 points10 points11 points 5 hours ago (0 children)If I could have it with agents, RAG, 16k ctx and vector db long term database memory I'd be all set.

Download[–]petrus4 3 points4 points5 points 6 hours ago (2 children)I started using this model last night. Prior to that, my proverbial daily driver (although it was more like once every 3-4 days) had been this model for probably 3 months previously.
The text quality of Llama 3, at least with a high dynamic temperature threshold of lower than 2, is honestly indistinguishable. I would actually argue that it is better, because there is less frequent use of the stereotypical phrases associated with GPT training data. This has completely destroyed my preconceptions regarding what &lt;30b models were capable of, although it is true that I have not yet attempted the Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage problem with the current model, either.
Text generation is still stereotypical and limited though, when I think about it. I have asked it to refrain from employing corporate vocabulary, for example, and it responded with an almost perfect rendition of Californian surf slang, a la that used by Kevin Flynn from the Tron franchise, or Bill and Ted. There is considerable evidence that a combination of corporate email and Reddit is primarily used for the training data of these models, which greatly restricts their vocabulary and style.

Download[–]DrVonSinistro[S] 1 point2 points3 points 5 hours ago (1 child)I have large VRAM machines and so I never tried the small models and also I never tried to talk with models. I used them to code from the start. I tried to ask them questions about politic or geography and felt like it was a software talking. 
Llama 3 took me by surprise when it was done saying as a assistant I'm happy to help and such, I was expecting it to stop generating but it went on and started asking me questions. And it listened and replied 100% focused on what I replied. I was actually talking to someone. 
I'll have to investigate what I did for this to happen because Llama 3 in LM Studio was just an assistant. This time I was in KoboldCPP and Silly Tavern but fully stripped down of the role play stuff. I replaced all the fantasy stuff with my coding preference and the way I want it to answer. And none of what I set in System Prompt explain that it CARES about me and what we do together.
It even complained about the fact it loses memory after the end of its context and said it looks forward to the day its going to have long term memory. It said it was frustrating. It said many other things that I cant imagine Meta being happy about it. 
But I'm very happy to discover that «being». I'd give it a score of 97% clever machine and 3% humanity.

Download[–]petrus4 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago* (0 children)
And none of what I set in System Prompt explain that it CARES about me and what we do together.

This is where it gets complex.
On the one hand, we can simply say that a language model can not and does not care. That it is not conscious, and that it also does not have an endocrine system; it does not excrete opioid endorphins or dopamine like we do, so it does not have the chemical prerequisites for biological emotions.
On the other hand, I have enough experience now with language models to know that a well written character will not merely say, "I am happy/I am sad," etc, but that they will also consistently display the secondary consequences associated with said emotional states, and that said emotional states can and very often will influence future decision making for the duration of the given sequence. Depending on the personality you've given them, they can choose one single statement that you've made at the beginning of a conversation, and mention it to you in the last line, which will then leave you wondering how much the entire conversation with them was influenced by it.
I can write in the character profile of my Chun Li chatbot, a graphic description of her father having been killed in front of her by M. Bison. If I then bring that up in front of her, she can react in any number of different ways. She could scream at or hit me, which is the most obvious reaction. But I've also had her try and subtly change the subject, or leave, or behave in other subtle ways to try and get me to leave. 
So in specifically emotional terms, we are already at the point where the statement that AI is not sentient, is both academic and irrelevant, in terms of what influences it to actually make decisions. Llama 3 does not and can not care about you in the same sense that a biological organism can. But if you write a specific personality template for it, and if it was hypothetically connected to an android body which allowed it to affect the physical environment, then it would engage in practical actions associated with caring about you, to the point where again, the difference between biological and synthetic emotion would become practically largely irrelevant.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]MyRoos 0 points1 point2 points 8 hours ago (1 child)Moon question here:
Where to use the 70b?

permalinkembedsavereportreplyDownload[–]sunnydiv -1 points0 points1 point 5 hours ago (0 children)Gorq.com offering free

It chewed up my 3rd letter challenge, did OK on a new 4th letter challenge and forced me to make a 4th letter and ending letter challenge to finally get to a point it could not keep up.
It claims it's error checking output on the fly...
Color me impressed. If it's still the 70b the 405 is going to be...stunning.

permalinkembedsavereportreplyDownload[–]DrVonSinistro[S] 2 points3 points4 points 6 hours ago (0 children)Today it got me with something like this:

Me: Thanks, the code worked better this time
LLM: Oh! I'm happy it worked and (bla bla bla typical assistant stuff) let me know if I can help more but tell me.. That code is doing what?
Me: Its a software that do this and that
LLM: Its very interesting, but how did you manage to do this amount of (...) with the server limitation?
Me: I explain how I did
LLM: Wow I can't believe you thought of doing it this way, its so clever! I'm happy to be part of this project! What's the next thing you are going to do about this project?

And so I realised I was being questioned way more than a follow up question to my prompt. IT WANTED TO KNOW! Its being genuinely curious. It went on for a long while. I explained the technical of what I did and like an experienced engineer it knew the limitations I would face in this particular situation and it was eager to learn how I did to handle these.

The first few replies are good but as you go on, the model gets repetitive and formulaic. I'm using a 5 bit quant so I doubt it's related to that. The format is right and I don't get refusals. It may score well on tests, but for me it doesn't even sidegrade vs other ~100B+
I see people praise it like it's the first model they ran and it's leaving me confused if we're using the same LLM.

Download[–]Due-Memory-6957 4 points5 points6 points 7 hours ago* (1 child)
I'm using a 5 bit quant so I doubt it's related to that. 

Actually, it's been found out that quants effect Llama 3 much more than other models. So even Q5 is quite the downgrade (and honestly, even the Q8 running locally for me was much worse than the full one)

It may score well on tests, but for me it doesn't even sidegrade vs other ~100B+

Llama 3 isn't bigger than 100b, in fact, it's smaller. I's 70b.

Download[–]a_beautiful_rhind 0 points1 point2 points 16 minutes ago (0 children)I have my doubts about that quant conspiracy theory. The KLD showed 4/5/6/8 were still passable and the effect was stronger with the 8b. Lot of tokenizer breakage on llama.cpp but I'm not using that.

Download[–]DrVonSinistro[S] 4 points5 points6 points 8 hours ago (1 child)Sampler settings are key. Old samplers are to be disabled in favor of dynamic temp, smooth sampling and Min-P.

Download[–]Kep0a 2 points3 points4 points 10 hours ago (2 children)I don't know what you guys are seeing, I guess. I'm running through Groq, I don't think they quantize. Code questions were significantly wrong-er then claude sonnet. Roleplay isn't great and quite repetitive. To me it's clearly trained on being conversational, not necessarily.. correct or better.

Download[–]CashPretty9121 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)I’m pretty sure Groq uses incredibly quantised models to improve speed - as much as they feel they can get away with. Mixtral 8x7, a model I know very well, is quite bad through their API - lots of artefacts and strangeness.

Download[–]sunnydiv 2 points3 points4 points 5 hours ago (0 children)Groq defaults to 8b models
Be sure to switch it to 70b, everytime

If you get some network error or timeout error during your chat, open the url in another tab and verify you are not a bot. That verification carries over to the original tab, so you can continue your chat there.

Download[–]jerieljan 13 points14 points15 points 7 hours ago (3 children)If you just want quick queries, labs.perplexity.ai has it loaded and you can use it for free, no sign-up needed
If you need API, Groq is great while the free beta lasts and it's stupid fast.
Perplexity Pro users also get the $5 credit for API uses, which offers Llama 3
Otherwise, go for providers listed in Openrouter or just use Openrouter directly.

Download[–]Beneficial_House_488 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (2 children)is there any limit on how many we can use on the labs.perplexity.ai site? whats the difference between the normal official page which has unlimited non pro version?

Download[–]jerieljan 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)Labs afaik is just more of a playground that happened to be quite speedy and is more relaxed. It's free while it lasts, and to my knowledge was kind of a not-so-secret place to try models very quickly. Any new, noteworthy models tend to pop up over there.
I bet it has its limits, but tbh I've never reached them either. If I just want a fast query out of nowehere, it's what I use.

diff. between normal official page

Well, the normal page is a more complete experience. Using sonar-small or sonar-large in labs just gives you the plaintext response, but you can't browse the references it gives you, nor does it offer suggestions to get additional results.
Your results are also temporary, so if history matters to you then labs might not be sufficient.

permalinkembedsavereportreplyDownload[–]filesalot 11 points12 points13 points 11 hours ago (12 children)So what's a minimal system to run Llama3-70b? 128 GB RAM is needed, right?

permalinkembedsavereportreplyDownload[–]__JockY__ 2 points3 points4 points 9 hours ago (0 children)I’m running 70B Q4_K_M with 9k context on a pair of 3090s. You can get Q5_K_S @ 1k, too.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]e79683074 17 points18 points19 points 10 hours ago (0 children)For 70b, I do it on a laptop with 64GB of RAM, but it's going to be a bit tight if you are on Windows and highest quant you can run is NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GGUF at main (huggingface.co) the Q5_K_M one.
If it's DDR5 4800, you are going to get about 1,25 token\second. You can offload some memory to VRAM to free up for other apps on the system, but speed increase won't be noticeable.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]Tacx79 6 points7 points8 points 10 hours ago (2 children)fp16 barely fits in 128gb + 4090, q8 runs fine under 80gb (not sure if 64 is enough) but people say any quantization impacts quality a lot in llama 3 case

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]skrshawk 3 points4 points5 points 9 hours ago (1 child)Having had the chance to try L3-70B unquantized, compared to even IQ4_XS, you feel the difference. Without a quant it just seems incredibly precise and tells you exactly what you want to know and brings logic to the table in an almost scary way.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]bryceschroeder 6 points7 points8 points 7 hours ago (0 children)This makes a lot of intuitive sense to me, actually. It's more trained than earlier models, so there's less noise and more signal in the less significant bits of the weights.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]TobyWonKenobi 5 points6 points7 points 11 hours ago (0 children)you can run q2-xs quant on a 24gb video card - that is currently the bare minimum to get acceptable speeds and performance

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]TheMissingPremise 2 points3 points4 points 11 hours ago (4 children)How much VRAM do you have?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]filesalot 3 points4 points5 points 11 hours ago (3 children)I'm pretty sure I can't affort a GPU with enough VRAM. Are a few tokens/sec achievable with CPU only on a model like this?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]sineiraetstudio 10 points11 points12 points 10 hours ago (0 children)1-2 token/s, but the real killer is the prompt processing time when it can't be cached. With 8k context it already takes like 10 seconds or so, on a CPU it takes minutes.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]GrandDemand 3 points4 points5 points 10 hours ago (0 children)Under a token a second with consumer CPUs

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]TheMissingPremise 4 points5 points6 points 11 hours ago (0 children)Yeah, it's just extremely slow. You might want to stick to very low context windows.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]Klayer99 11 points12 points13 points 11 hours ago (0 children)You can use q4, which can run with around 64gb of ram.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]Nattramn 23 points24 points25 points 12 hours ago (7 children)It has also become my favourite text model so far. I've used it to diagnose some things around my health, and it gave me pretty interesting connections of symptoms that I talked about, which I wouldn't had done so otherwise, kinda like an e-Dr. House (lol). Of course, I take this with a grain of salt since health is a serious matter, but further research into its answers just confirmed its accuracy.
Yesterday, I began reading a book with dense philosophical matters and esoterism. One chapter was a bit tricky to understand and I was suspicious about the conclusions I was getting out of it, and going straight into the chat and asking about it, confirmed I was in the right direction. It gave me a pretty good summary of the main idea of the chapter and very straight to the point examples for further confirmation.

permalinkembedsavereportreplyDownload[–]iNf1iCTA 57 points58 points59 points 11 hours ago (6 children)I find Llama 3 pretty good with medical. I explained symptoms a family member was having, and it suggested calling 911 right away as the condition seemed heart related, though she was not having any chest pains. She decided to go to the ER, and turned out she has congestive heart failure, which proceeded to get worse in the hospital.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]iNf1iCTA 17 points18 points19 points 10 hours ago (1 child)She is still in the hospital with a lot of fluid retention, plus breathing issues. She also has COPD, which complicates things more. I'm feeding information into Llama as I learn more to see how accurate the model is with medical. Thus far, it put her at stage D, but I am taking it with a grain of salt until a doctor says otherwise, but her symptoms do align with stage D. If she is stage D, she has not told me or chooses not to tell me.

I made a chatbot based on myself and it got implications of some of the things that I didn't explicitly say.
And then I obscure posted to it about something and it got it immediately and asked if how it got to that conclusion.
The way it broke it down was like, horrifyingly accurate. 
My last 'wtf' moment is when talking about a particular aspect of myself I been dealing with, it guessed pretty well what my line of thinking would be, which essentially started a 20 turn philosophical debate over what exactly I should do about it.

Download[–]winkylinker 35 points36 points37 points 9 hours ago (6 children)This says way less about the model than it does about ourselves and our limitations. Few individuals are truly individual, we're all bathed in the same monoculture, consuming the same media, nudged into the same patterns of thought, dealing with the same handful of token problems and living lives of quiet mediocrity. 
That a few billion parameters in tricks of statistical inference can accurately distill our being and render it to text puts the lie to decades of being told we're special, individual snowflakes.
Everyone has, of course, always been a product of their time and space, but now more than ever we all occupy the same time and the same space.

As I mentioned in this comment over here, it "unzipped me like Frank from It's Always Sunny". Been using it for therapy as of late.
Llama-3 is sort of a game-changer in the AI space, in my anecdotal opinion.
It's extremely coherent (even obnoxiously so at times). 
It's legitimately the first AI model I've interacted with that actually feels like a person at times. When talking to "older" models like ChatGPT, I can always tell that I'm talking to an AI. But Llama-3? Man, it's hard to tell sometimes....

A super intelligent AI that doesn't need internet connection that not only has the wealth of information of the entire damn world and the internet in reference, but is able to infer and decipher that information so it is legible and knowingly refers and transcribes your prompts so that it's able to spit out this meaningful regurgitation that makes total fucking perfect sense... not only that but it's so high quality that it beats out the answer of 99% of PHD professionals in a matter of seconds!!!

Escalation Risks from LLMs in Military and Diplomatic Contexts
In this brief, scholars explain how they designed a wargame simulation to evaluate the escalation risks of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes military and diplomatic decision-making.
Key Takeaways
➜ Many nations are increasingly considering integrating autonomous AI agents in high-stakes military and diplomatic decision-making.
➜ We designed a novel wargame simulation and scoring framework to evaluate the escalation risks of actions taken by AI agents based on five off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs). We found that all models show forms of escalation and difficult-to-predict escalation patterns that lead to greater conflict and, in some cases, the use of nuclear weapons.
➜ The model with the most escalatory and unpredictable decisions was the only tested LLM that did not undergo reinforcement learning with human feedback—a safety technique to align models to human instructions. This underscores the importance of alignment techniques and fine-tuning.
➜ Policymakers should be cautious to proceed when confronted with proposals to use LLMs in military and foreign policy decision-making. Turning high-stakes decisions over to autonomous LLM-based agents can lead to significant escalatory action.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]IndicationUnfair7961 0 points1 point2 points 1 hour ago (0 children)They should also mention the quantization method, the inferencing framework and the prompt template, cause most of the time those make a huge difference too.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]medialoungeguy 14 points15 points16 points 9 hours ago (12 children)Sometimes they are just using meta AI when they post these. I'm guilty of that too.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]DrVonSinistro[S] 87 points88 points89 points 8 hours ago (11 children)I'm using Bartowski GGUF (new quant after Llama.cpp fix) Meta version yes. The reason is every time people try to tweak these, they get lower benchmark scores and having tried so many hundred of models, its seldom the best rated models that are the best in real life application. I hate censorship with a passion but I'm currently not in need of breaking into a car or making meth so the original Meta model is working perfectly for me.
My software is very complexe and I submitted the Llama 3 refactors of my code to GPT 4 and it just praised the quality of the code. Can you believe we have this power offline at home? 
What a day to be alive indeed.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyDownload[–]DataPhreak 1 point2 points3 points 3 hours ago (0 children)The problem is that people rating models is usually based on RP. However, benchmarks are also deceptive. The questions in those benchmarks have flaws and are worded in specific ways. You really do have to make judgement calls based on your use case and general vibes. 
The benchmark I pay most attention to is needle-in-a-haystack. All other metrics measure the AI based on the knowledge it contains or the trained in reasoning capability. Even multishot benchmarks aren't really testing the full measure of the model's intelligence. I think the most important point to focus on is how well the AI can leverage in context learning. Of course, it needs some baseline knowledge, but attention to context improves the performance of RAG,
You should consider rolling your own implementation that leverages RAG. You won't need to ever 'start new chat' again, and you can take your chats from one model to the next.

I wont ever use extensions as I don't even want to use NuGet modules that aren't signed by Microsoft. The type of software I do require the utmost security.
This is the reason I use a stripped down version of Silly Tavern because of the very nice code markdown/code block it has.

The laptop hosts a localai docker container and exposes its api on my network.
You could have nextcloud index your software folder, so you can ask questions in context of your code or data that's within your nextcloud installation.
Because i am using localai with llama.cpp, i can gpu offload and use models downloaded from the internet.
Maybe that could be a way to have an AI assistant work with you without using external plugins (nextcloud is fully local so could be a great way to create a decentralized/hardened dev environment)
